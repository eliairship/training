## User Story

**As a** developer learning Next.js and React Server Components  
**I want** a comprehensive lesson that covers React Server Components concepts, implementation patterns, and best practices  
**So that** I can understand how to effectively use Server Components in Next.js applications and make informed decisions about when to use Server vs Client Components

---

## Detailed Description

### Context and Rationale

React Server Components represent a significant paradigm shift in how we build React applications, offering improved performance, better SEO, and enhanced developer experience. With Next.js App Router's adoption of Server Components as the default, developers need comprehensive training materials to understand this architecture.

This user story addresses the need for educational content in our training repository located at `/Users/eli.marshall/code/training` that will help developers transition from traditional Client Components to the Server Component model.

### Business Value

- **Educational Impact**: Provides developers with essential knowledge for modern Next.js development
- **Performance Benefits**: Teaches patterns that lead to faster, more efficient applications
- **Industry Relevance**: Aligns with current React and Next.js best practices and future direction
- **Skill Development**: Enhances developer capabilities in server-side rendering and component architecture

- Data fetching implementations with Server Components
- Mixed Server/Client Component integration patterns
- File structure examples following Next.j App Router conventions

### AC4: Next.js App Router Integration
**Given** a developer using Next.js 13+ with App Router  
**When** they study the integration section  
**Then** they should learn:
- File-based routing with Server Components
- Loading states and error boundaries implementation
- Streaming and Suspense patterns
- Layout composition strategies

### AC5: Best Practices and Pitfall Guidance
**Given** a developer implementing Server Components in production  
**When** they reference the best practices and pitfalls sections  
**Then** they should understand:
- Component organization strategies
- Performance optimization techniques
- Common mistakes and how to avoid them
- Debugging approaches for Server/Client boundary issues

### AC6: Consistent Formatting and Structure
**Given** the existing lesson template structure  
**When** the new lesson is created  
**Then** it should:
- Follow the established lesson template format from `/Users/eli.marshall/code/training/lesson-template.md`
- Include proper markdown formatting with headers, code blocks, and lists
- Maintain consistency with existing lessons in the repository
- Include exercises and practical activities where appropriate

## Dependencies and Considerations

### Dependencies
- **Existing Lesson Template**: Must follow structure from `/Users/eli.marshall/code/training/lesson-template.md`
