# Introduction to Claude Code

## What is Claude Code?

Claude Code is Anthropic's official CLI tool that brings the power of Claude AI directly to your terminal. It's designed to:

- **Accelerate development**: Turn ideas into code faster
- **Debug efficiently**: Analyze and fix issues with AI assistance
- **Navigate codebases**: Understand any project quickly
- **Automate tasks**: Streamline repetitive development work

## Key Differentiators

### Direct File Editing

Unlike chat interfaces, Claude Code can directly:

- Edit files in your project
- Run terminal commands
- Create commits
- Execute tests

### Terminal-Native

```bash
# Works where developers work
cd your-project
claude "Help me refactor this authentication module"
```

### Composable and Scriptable

```bash
# Pipe from any command
git diff | claude "Review these changes"
npm test 2>&1 | claude "Fix failing tests"
```

## Real-World Use Cases

1. **Feature Development**

   - "Build a user dashboard with charts"
   - "Add dark mode to this React app"

2. **Debugging**

   - "Why is this API endpoint failing?"
   - "Fix this memory leak"

3. **Code Understanding**

   - "Explain this legacy codebase"
   - "Document this API"

4. **Refactoring**
   - "Modernize this jQuery code to React"
   - "Extract this into microservices"
