## Course Content

### Lambda Core Concepts - Functions, Events, and Execution Model

- **What is AWS Lambda?**

  - Serverless compute service that runs code in response to events
  - No server management required - AWS handles infrastructure
  - Pay only for compute time consumed
  - Automatic scaling based on incoming requests

- **Lambda Function Structure**

  - **Handler Function**: Entry point for your code execution
  - **Event Object**: Contains data from the triggering service
  - **Context Object**: Runtime information and methods
  - **Return Value**: Response sent back to the caller

- **Execution Environment**

  - Features:
    - Secure, isolated runtime environment
    - Pre-initialized execution contexts for better performance
    - Temporary disk space (/tmp) up to 10GB
    - Environment variables for configuration
  - Supported Runtimes:
    - Python, Node.js, Java, C#, Ruby, Go, PowerShell
    - Custom runtimes using Lambda Runtime API

- **Lambda Limits and Quotas**
  - Maximum execution time: 15 minutes
  - Memory allocation: 128 MB to 10,008 MB
  - Deployment package size: 50 MB (zipped), 250 MB (unzipped)
  - Concurrent executions: 1,000 (default, can be increased)

**Exercise:**

- Create a simple "Hello World" Lambda function using the AWS Console
- Examine the default function structure and test it
- Modify the function to return custom JSON response

---

### Hands-On - Creating and Deploying Your First Lambda Function

- **Using AWS Console**

  - Creating a function from scratch
  - Choosing runtime and architecture
  - Writing inline code vs uploading packages
  - Configuring basic settings (timeout, memory, environment variables)

- **Function Code Examples**

Python Example:

```python
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Extract data from event
    name = event.get('name', 'World')

    # Business logic
    message = f"Hello, {name}!"

    # Return response
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps({
            'message': message,
            'timestamp': context.aws_request_id
        })
    }
```

Node.js Example:

```javascript
exports.handler = async (event) => {
  const name = event.name || 'World';

  const response = {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({
      message: `Hello, ${name}!`,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    }),
  };

  return response;
};
```

- **Testing and Debugging**
  - Using the built-in test functionality
  - Creating test events
  - Reading CloudWatch logs
  - Understanding cold vs warm starts

**Exercise:**

- Create a Lambda function that processes a simple calculation
- Configure memory and timeout settings
- Test with different input payloads
- Review execution logs in CloudWatch

### Event Sources and Integrations - API Gateway, S3, DynamoDB

- **Synchronous Event Sources**

  - **API Gateway**: HTTP/REST API endpoints
    - Request/response model
    - Integration types: Lambda proxy vs custom
    - Error handling and status codes
  - **Application Load Balancer**: HTTP requests from ALB
  - **Lambda Function URLs**: Direct HTTPS endpoints

- **Asynchronous Event Sources**

  - **S3**: Object creation, deletion, modification events
    - Event notification configuration
    - Batch processing capabilities
  - **DynamoDB Streams**: Real-time data changes
  - **SNS**: Message publication events
  - **EventBridge**: Custom application events

- **Stream-based Event Sources**

  - **Kinesis**: Real-time data streaming
  - **DynamoDB Streams**: Database change capture
  - **SQS**: Message queue processing

- **Event Structure Examples**

API Gateway Event:

```json
{
  "httpMethod": "POST",
  "path": "/users",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "body": "{\"name\":\"John\",\"email\":\"john@example.com\"}",
  "pathParameters": null,
  "queryStringParameters": { "limit": "10" }
}
```

S3 Event:

```json
{
  "Records": [
    {
      "eventName": "ObjectCreated:Put",
      "s3": {
        "bucket": { "name": "my-bucket" },
        "object": { "key": "uploads/image.jpg", "size": 1024 }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Exercise:**

- Create an API Gateway that triggers a Lambda function
- Set up an S3 bucket event to process uploaded files
- Test both integrations with sample data
- Configure error handling for failed invocations

### Advanced Topics  Layers, Custom Runtimes, Error Handling

- **Lambda Layers**

  - **Purpose**: Share code, libraries, and configuration across functions
  - **Benefits**:

    - Reduce deployment package size
    - Share common dependencies
    - Separate business logic from utilities

  - **Layer Structure**:

    ```
    layer.zip
       python/
           lib/
               python3.9/
                   site-packages/
    ```

  - **Use Cases**:
    - Common utility functions
    - Third-party libraries
    - Configuration files
    - Custom runtimes

- **Error Handling Patterns**

  - **Retry Behavior**

    - Synchronous: Client handles retries
    - Asynchronous: Lambda retries automatically (3 times)
    - Stream-based: Process continues with next batch

  - **Dead Letter Queues (DLQ)**

    - Capture failed asynchronous invocations
    - Configure SQS or SNS as destination
    - Analyze and reprocess failed events

  - **Destination Configuration**
    - On success: Send results to another service
    - On failure: Route errors for handling
    - Supports SQS, SNS, EventBridge, Lambda

- **Custom Runtimes**

  - Support for any programming language
  - Lambda Runtime API integration
  - Packaging with runtime dependencies
  - Examples: Rust, PHP, R, COBOL

    - Alias-based traffic shifting
    - Gradual rollout strategies
    - Automatic rollback on errors

  - **Infrastructure as Code**
    - AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model)
    - AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit)
    - Terraform and CloudFormation

**Exercise:**

- Create a Lambda layer with common utilities
- Implement error handling with DLQ configuration
