## Talking points

- [ ] Inline chat vs. sidebar chat
- [ ] Using @ for context
- [ ] Review AI related changes. "Prompt AI to build a feature and show users how to review the changes/diff."
- [ ] Sliding Context window. Start new chats for each topic. It speeds up the AI response
- [ ] Rules: Define custom instructions for Agent behavior. Rules help maintain coding standards, enforce patterns, and personalize how Agent assists with your project


## Exercises
